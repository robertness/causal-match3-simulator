"""The structural causal model, one function per node of the DAG.

Every node gets its own function taking its parents as arguments, so the graph

    L -> D,  L -> E,  D -> E,  K -> E,  D -> S_0,  E -> S_0,  L -> S_t,
    K -> A_t,  S_T -> R,  K -> X

can be read straight off the call sites in :func:`ground_truth_model`.

Two conventions hold throughout:

* Every node function accepts ``value=``. Passing it clamps the node, which is
    how interventions are expressed: ``sample_E(D, L, K, value=1.2)`` is
  ``do(E = 1.2)``.
* ``pyro.sample`` appears at stochastic SCM nodes and gameplay events: the root
    variables, noisy treatment and proxy, opening deal, refill colours, and
    player's choice of swap. Match detection, gravity and cascade resolution are
    deterministic given those draws and are recorded with ``pyro.deterministic``.

The load-bearing structural choice is that ``E`` is the difficulty the policy
*served*, not how hard the level *felt*. Skill reaches the outcome through
``K -> A_t``, independently of ``E``. Were skill instead absorbed into ``E``, the
two would be d-separated from ``R`` given ``E`` and there would be no confounding
to correct.
